# Unity Capstone Project for Epicodus
#### Project by Elliot McGonigal
## Description
This is a game in Unity where you complete tasks to get a higher score. It is fantasy themed with a goblin and a baby dragon making an appearance.
## Technologies Used
* C#
* Unity
* Unity Editor
* Git
* VSCode

## Known Bugs/Issues
- The sword can disappear in the pillar and complete the pillar task.
- The goblin's movement is super weird and jittery.
- No pop-up when you complete a task, so it is sometimes confusing when you get two tasks in a row.

### Research & Planning Log
#### Sunday, 11/6
* 0:00: Starting Capstone proposal
* 0:30: Finishing Capstone proposal

#### Sunday 11/27
* 3:00 - 3:50: Set up git ignore, set up new 3d unity project, get project to properly add and commit with git, struggle with git for 20 minutes, finally get it to work
* 3:50 - 4:40 learn more about movement through a tutorial, learn that it differs from VR movement a lot more than I had realized, much to learn and should be fun to implement
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaJseHy_iI4&list=PLS7jk2aVN8G4b-uuf-M0_fhQjL7KEmQwU found good tutorial series to reference - has up to date info rather than the years old out of date stuff in a lot of tutorials
* 6:40: Read about input systems - https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Input.html
* 7:10: Try and get movement working, but it's still very janky


#### Sunday 12/11 - Tuesday 12/13
* Went through series on movement after learning that the one I learned did not work with the form of score keeping I was trying to use. https://www.youtube.com/@Yeahlowflicker - 4 hours
* Learned more about collision on Unity https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/CollidersOverview.html   -  1 hour
* Learned how to get others scripts to see my functions. https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Input.html   -  3 hours
