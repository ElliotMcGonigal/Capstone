# Unity Task Game

### This will be a 3d Unity based game where a user will move around and complete objectives in a world that I have built. 

## MVP: User can navigate the world and complete basic objectives. These objectives include things such as: 
* Go to x location
* Defeat x enemies
* Aquire certain target
* Deliver certain target

## Tools and resources: 
* C#
* Unity for creating/placing/building assets and the world itself
* Unity Editor/Unity Hub/Many other Unity tools
* VSCode for editing and creating scripts

## Stretch Goals
* Adding depth to combat (health/damage/range of enemies)
* Adding updating status (health bar/resource bars/statistics)
* Adding more movement mechanics (jumping/climbing/sprinting/maybe interactables that change movement)
* Add more levels past the main one

## Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?
I'm really looking forward to this project, I'm super excited to see how it turns out!
